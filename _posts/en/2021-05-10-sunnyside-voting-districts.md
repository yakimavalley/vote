All Sunnyside city council elections in 2021 are for district positions. This means that candidates can only run for a position if they reside within the district boundaries for that position. If more than two candidates run for the same position, the county will schedule an August primary for which only registered voters in that district can vote. The two candidates with the most primary votes advance to the general election held in November. Every Sunnyside resident votes in the general election for every candidate, regardless of the district they represent.
